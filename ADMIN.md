# The admin portal

A private site at **https://admin.ahmadnadeem.dev** for running Articles and editing your portfolio.

| Section | What you can do |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | Totals, a 30-day publishing chart, most viewed and most clapped posts |
| Posts | **Write, edit and publish** your own posts. Every post including drafts: search, filter, **take down**, **delete** |
| Comments | Every comment across the site: **remove** |
| Topics | **Rename**, **merge** and **delete** tags |
| Portfolio | Create, edit and delete your site's **blog**, **projects** and **updates** (Markdown, with a live preview) |
| Subscribers | Readers who asked for new articles by email; **remove** an address |
| Site | The public site's **theme**, and the **categories** posts are shelved in |
| Profile | Your name, photo, bio and website, as readers see them beside every post |
| Activity | A history of what has been done in the portal, kept for 180 days |

Sign-up stays closed. Only your own account can sign in, with your email and a code from an
authenticator app. There is no password on this site: your phone is the key, so keep it locked.

 admin.ahmadnadeem.dev  ──>  Render API (Articles)  ──>  GitHub (private portfolio repo)
 Cloudflare Workers          /api/v1/admin/*            every save is a commit
                                                              │
                                                  Cloudflare rebuilds ahmadnadeem.dev
```

Portfolio edits are **commits to a private GitHub repository**. That keeps the portfolio a fast static
site, gives you full history and undo, and costs nothing. Cloudflare rebuilds the site by itself about
a minute after each save.

Everything here is on free plans and none of it needs a card.

---

## Setup

Four steps, in this order. Steps 1 and 4 are required; 2 and 3 are only for portfolio editing, and
the rest of the portal works without them.

### 1. Create your authenticator secret (2 minutes)

You need an authenticator app on your phone (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy,
1Password, any of them). From the `inkwell` folder, using your **Articles login email**:

```powershell
dotnet run --project tools/Inkwell.AdminSetup -- you@example.com
```

It shows a QR code, you scan it, type the code your app displays to prove it works, and it prints two
lines. Add them as environment variables on your Render service (Environment tab), then save so it
redeploys:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `Admin__Emails__0` | the email address you gave the tool |
| `Admin__TotpSecret` | the secret it printed |

The secret is as sensitive as a password. Don't paste it into chat, email or the repository. The QR
image is deleted when the tool finishes.

> If you ever lose your phone, run the tool again and replace `Admin__TotpSecret` on Render. The old
> secret stops working immediately.

### 2. Put your portfolio in its own private GitHub repo (5 minutes)

Today `portfolio-site` lives inside your larger `Claude` folder. The portal needs it as its own repo.

1. On GitHub, create a **private** repository, for example `portfolio`. Leave it empty.
2. Then:

   ```powershell
   cd portfolio-site
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   The existing `.gitignore` keeps `node_modules`, `dist` and `.astro` out. Check `git status` before
   pushing if you want to be sure nothing private is included.
3. Make Cloudflare build it from that repo, so a push (including one from the portal) redeploys the site.
   In the Cloudflare dashboard open **Workers & Pages**, then your portfolio Worker
   (`ahmadnadeemanwar`), then **Settings → Builds → Connect**, and choose the repository. Use
   `npm run build` as the build command and `npx wrangler deploy` as the deploy command. A
   `wrangler.jsonc` is already in `portfolio-site` for this.

   Free plans include [3,000 build minutes a month](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/limits-and-pricing/),
   far more than editing needs.

### 3. Give the API permission to edit that repo (3 minutes)

1. GitHub → **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens →
   Generate new token**.
2. **Repository access: Only select repositories**, and pick the portfolio repo (nothing else).
3. **Permissions → Repository permissions → Contents: Read and write.** Leave everything else off.
4. Set an expiry (GitHub allows up to a year) and put a reminder in your calendar to renew it.
5. On Render, add these environment variables:

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `Portfolio__Repo` | `your-username/portfolio` |
   | `Portfolio__Token` | the token GitHub just showed you (shown once) |
   | `Portfolio__Branch` | optional, defaults to `main` |

Never paste the token anywhere except Render. Because it is limited to one repository and one
permission, the worst a leaked token could do is change your portfolio's files, and every change is in
git history.

### 4. Deploy the admin site (5 minutes)

First push the API so it has the admin routes (Render redeploys by itself):

```powershell
git push
```

Then the admin app:

```powershell
cd admin
npm install
npm run build
npx.cmd wrangler deploy
```

`wrangler deploy` creates `admin.ahmadnadeem.dev` and its DNS record. Open it and sign in with your
email and the current 6-digit code.

> If your API URL isn't `https://inkwell-zpbc.onrender.com`, change it in **both**
> `admin/.env.production` and `admin/public/_headers` before building.

---

## Email subscriptions (optional, about 20 minutes)

Readers can subscribe on the public site and get a short email when you announce a new article.
Until the steps below are done the subscribe form simply does not appear, and nothing else is affected.

Mail is sent through **Brevo**. Its free plan allows 300 emails a day and, at the time of writing,
asks for no card. **If any step asks for payment details, stop**: do not enter them.

1. **Create the account.** Sign up at brevo.com and finish its email verification.
2. **Prove you own the domain**, so your mail is not treated as spam. In Brevo open
   *Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs* → *Domains* → *Add a domain* and enter `ahmadnadeem.dev`.
   Brevo shows a few records (a verification code, a DKIM record, and DMARC). In the Cloudflare
   dashboard open the domain → *DNS* → *Records* and add each one exactly as shown. For any CNAME
   record set the proxy to **DNS only** (grey cloud). Back in Brevo press *Verify*; it can take a
   few minutes.
3. **Add a sender.** In *Senders* add an address on your domain, for example
   `articles@ahmadnadeem.dev`, with the name `Articles by Ahmad Nadeem`. It does not need a mailbox to send, but replies
   to it go nowhere unless you later set up forwarding (Cloudflare Email Routing is free).
4. **Make an API key.** *SMTP & API* → *API Keys* → *Generate a new API key*. It is shown once.
5. **Give it to the API.** On Render, open your service → *Environment* and add:

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `Email__ApiKey` | the key Brevo just showed you |
   | `Email__FromAddress` | the sender address from step 3 |

   Save, and Render redeploys. Never paste the key into chat, email or the repository.
6. **Try it.** Open the public site, subscribe with your own address at the bottom of any page,
   click the link in the email, and check the address shows as *Subscribed* under **Subscribers**.

If a confirmation email does not arrive, look at Render → *Logs* for a line starting "Brevo refused
an email": it says why (most often an unverified domain or sender, or an account Brevo has not yet
activated for sending).

**How it works**
- A reader is not subscribed until they click the link in the confirmation email, so nobody can
  sign up someone else. An address is sent at most one confirmation a day.
- Nothing is sent automatically. After publishing, press **Notify subscribers** beside the post on
  the Posts page. It says how many will be emailed and asks first.
- Nobody is told about the same post twice. *Notify again* only reaches people who subscribed since.
- If you have more subscribers than the daily allowance, one press sends the first 300; press again
  the next day for the rest.
- Every email has an unsubscribe link. Unsubscribed addresses are kept, marked as such, so they are
  never emailed by mistake; **Remove** deletes an address entirely.

## Picture generation (optional, about 10 minutes)

The editor can make a picture from a description, on Cloudflare's **free** Workers AI allowance
(10,000 "neurons" a day, which is well over 20 pictures). Until the steps below are done, the
*Generate with AI* button only explains that it is not set up.

**If any step asks for a card or offers to upgrade, stop and do not enter anything.** On the free plan
a spent allowance makes the request fail; it never bills you. Do not switch the account to
*Workers Paid*. As a second safeguard the site itself refuses after **20 pictures a UTC day**,
counted in the database, so a restart does not reset it.

1. **Find your account id.** In the Cloudflare dashboard open *Workers & Pages*. The *Account ID* is
   in the right-hand column. Copy it. It is an identifier, not a secret.
2. **Create a token.** Open *My Profile* (top right) → *API Tokens* → *Create Token*. Choose the
   **Workers AI** template (or *Create Custom Token* with the permission *Account → Workers AI → Read*
   plus *Edit* if offered), restrict it to your account, and create it. Copy the token now; Cloudflare
   shows it once.
3. **Give both to the API.** In Render open the Articles service → *Environment* and add
   `ImageGeneration__AccountId` (the id) and `ImageGeneration__ApiToken` (the token). Save; Render
   redeploys. Never paste the token into this repository, the workboard or a chat.
4. **Try it.** In the editor add an *Image* section and press *Generate with AI*.

How it behaves: you describe the picture, wait up to half a minute, and see a **preview**. Nothing is
stored until you press *Keep this picture*; *Try again* makes another (it counts toward the 20). A kept
picture is shrunk and stored like any upload, and its description fills *Describe the picture* if that
was empty. Your description is sent to Cloudflare. Every picture made is listed in the *Activity* page.

If it fails: *Cloudflare refused the request* means the token or its permission is wrong (make a new
one, update Render). *Free allowance is used up* means wait for midnight UTC.

## Using it

**Writing:** *New post* (on the Dashboard and the Posts page) opens the editor; *Edit* appears beside
every post that is yours.
- A post is a list of **sections**. *Add a section* offers **Text**, **Image** and **References**.
  Each section has arrows to move it up or down, and a cross to delete it.
- **Image:** choose a picture from your device. It is shrunk in the browser (1600 pixels on its
  longer side at most) and stored in the site's own database, so no other service is involved.
  JPEG, PNG and WebP only. *Describe the picture* is read aloud to people who cannot see it.
- **References:** a numbered list of sources. Each needs a title; the link is optional.
- **Check grammar:** under every text section. It sends that section's text to LanguageTool's free
  public service and lists spelling and grammar suggestions. Nothing changes until you press a
  suggested word (it replaces the flagged words, keeping bold or links), and *Ignore* dismisses one.
  Only the section you press the button on is sent; no reader data is involved. Free and needs no
  account or key. Limits: 15 checks a minute, and about 15,000 characters per section; if the service
  is busy you get a message to try again. Sections longer than the limit need splitting in two.
- A post that readers cannot see saves itself a few seconds after you stop typing. A published post
  is live, so changes to it wait until you press *Save changes*.

**Post status:** a post is in exactly one of three states, changed from the *Status* menu in the
editor or in the Posts list.

| Status | Who can see it |
|---|---|
| Draft | Only you. Not finished yet. |
| Published | Everyone. The first publish fixes its address for good. |
| Not active | Only you. Switched off; it keeps its address, so publishing again restores the same link. |

**Theme:** under *Site*, choose how the public site looks to every reader: *Deep blue* or *Sea green*
(white pages with a sea-green header and accents). Readers see the change the next time they open
the site. Readers whose device is set to dark get a dark version of whichever theme you choose.

**Categories:** broad shelves such as "Life and lessons". Add, rename and delete them under *Site*
(up to 12), and choose one for a post under *Category* in the editor. The public home page shows a
tab for each category that has a published post. Renaming keeps a category's address; deleting one
keeps its posts, which simply have no category. Topics are separate and unchanged.

**Post addresses:** a newly published post is read at `/read/its-title-k3x9p`. The short code at the
end is added once, at first publish, and never changes, so retitling a post does not break its link.
Posts published before this keep their plain address, and old `/p/...` links still open.

**Earlier versions:** in the editor, *Earlier versions* (under Topics) lists saved copies of a post.
A copy is kept when the title or the writing changes, at most once every ten minutes, and the newest
30 are kept. *Restore* puts a version back into the editor as unsaved changes; nothing is overwritten
until you press Save.

**Backup:** *Export all* on the Posts page saves every post, including drafts and posts that are not
active, to one file on your device. It holds each post's words as plain text and its full body with
sections. Pictures are not inside the file; it records which pictures each post uses.

**Activity:** sign-ins (and failed attempts on your address), status changes made from the Posts
list or the editor's Status menu, deletions, topic changes, portfolio saves and exports. Writing and
saving a post is not listed; that is what *Earlier versions* is for.

**No passwords anywhere:** the deployed site has email-and-password sign-in switched off
(`Accounts:AllowPasswordSignIn` is false in production). The authenticator code is the only way in,
and the public site has no sign-in page at all.

**Reader numbers:** readers have no accounts, so the site tells them apart by a random id each
browser makes up for itself. Only a scrambled form of it is stored, and it is not tied to a person.
- **Claps** and **Insightful** count readers, not clicks: one of each per reader per post, and a
  second click takes it back.
- **Views** count one per reader per post per day. They are reported by the reader's browser once
  the post is on screen, so refreshes, search-engine crawlers and link previews are left out.
- These are honest but not tamper-proof: someone who clears their browser's site data counts as a
  new reader. Each address is limited to 30 reactions a minute.
- Comments are no longer shown on the public site. Existing ones remain in the Comments section.

**Image storage allowance:** the free database holds 0.5 GB in total. Images are capped at 300 MB
together, about 1,500 pictures at a typical 200 KB each. When the cap is reached, uploads are
refused with a clear message; nothing is charged and nothing already stored is affected.
- Unsaved writing is also kept in your browser. If the 2-hour session ends or the tab closes
  mid-sentence, reopen the post and choose *Restore it*.

**Posts** and **Comments** act immediately and always ask first. *Take down* returns a post to draft
(its author can republish it); *Delete* is permanent.

**Topics:** renaming changes the display name only; the address (`/tag/<slug>`) never changes, so
existing links keep working. *Merge* moves every post and follower onto the other topic, then removes
the first. *Delete* removes the topic from its posts but keeps the posts.

**Portfolio:** pick Blog, Projects or Updates.
- **New entry** creates a Markdown file. The file name is chosen once, from the title by default, and
  can't be changed afterwards because it is the entry's address.
- Fields follow your site's schema, and the API checks everything again before committing, so a
  mistake can't break the site's build. It tells you exactly what to fix.
- Saved files use the same formatting as your existing ones, so editing one field changes one line.
- If you or anything else changed the same file on GitHub while you had it open, the save is refused
  and your edit stays on screen. Nothing is overwritten.
- Deleting removes the file, but it stays in git history on GitHub.

Admin actions are recorded in the API's logs (Render → Logs) with your email and what was changed.

## How it is protected

- **One factor: the authenticator code.** The admin token comes only from
  `/api/v1/admin/auth/login`, which needs an email on the admin list and a current code. Ordinary
  sign-in tokens never work on admin routes, even with the right password. A code works once.
  This is a deliberate trade of some safety for convenience: whoever holds your unlocked phone can
  get in, and a code is only 6 digits, which is why wrong guesses are limited so tightly (below).
- **Revocable instantly.** The admin list is checked on every request, so removing your email from
  `Admin__Emails__0` locks that account out at once.
- **Short sessions.** An admin session lasts 2 hours and lives in the browser tab only; closing the
  tab signs you out.
- **Throttled.** 5 sign-in attempts per minute per visitor, and the account locks for an hour after
  5 wrong codes, wherever they came from. That holds a determined guesser to about 120 tries a day
  out of a million possible codes. Every failure gets the same message, so it never reveals which
  part was wrong. The cost: someone who knows your email can keep you locked out by guessing.
- **Locked-down site.** The admin site sends a strict content policy, can't be framed, and is hidden
  from search engines.
- **Narrow GitHub access.** The token reaches one repository with one permission, only
  `blog`, `projects` and `updates` can be edited, and file paths are restricted so nothing outside the
  content folder can be touched.

## Troubleshooting

| You see | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| "Invalid email or code" | One of the two is wrong. Check the email is on `Admin__Emails__0`, wait for a *new* code (each works once), and check your phone's clock is set automatically. |
| "Too many failed attempts" | Wait an hour, or fix `Admin__TotpSecret` if the app and server disagree. |
| Sign-in works but pages say you're signed out | The email isn't on the admin list any more, or the session ended (2 hours). Sign in again. |
| Portfolio shows setup instructions | `Portfolio__Repo` or `Portfolio__Token` is missing on Render. |
| "GitHub rejected the token" | It expired or was revoked. Create a new one and update Render. |
| "GitHub refused the request" | The token lacks **Contents: Read and write** on that repository. |
| Saved, but the site didn't change | Cloudflare's build may have failed. Check **Workers & Pages → your Worker → Deployments**. |

## Limits worth knowing

- The code-replay memory and the lockout counters live in the API's memory, which is right for one
  server. They reset when Render restarts the service, which only gives an attacker a fresh window,
  not access.
- The portfolio editor handles Markdown and the fields in your schema. It doesn't upload images; link to
  images by URL for now. (Articles posts do upload images.)
- A picture removed from a post stays in the database; there is no screen yet to delete unused ones.
- Pictures are served by the API on Render, so the first one after the server has been idle is slow.
- To try the portal on your own machine, the API's development settings include a throwaway admin
  (`maya@example.com`) and authenticator secret. They exist only in `appsettings.Development.json` and
  are never used by the deployed site.
- If you change `src/content.config.ts` in the portfolio, update the matching rules in
  `src/Inkwell.Application/Portfolio/PortfolioContent.cs` and `admin/src/portfolio/schema.ts`.
