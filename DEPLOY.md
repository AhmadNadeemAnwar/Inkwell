Every service below is on a free plan that needs **no credit card**. If any signup page asks for
one, stop and check you picked the free option.

| Service | Free allowance | What to expect |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare Workers (static assets) | Unlimited static requests | Nothing to watch |
| Render web service (Free) | 750 instance-hours/month (one service running 24/7 uses ~744) | Sleeps after 15 min idle; the first request after a nap takes ~30-50 s |
| Neon Postgres (Free) | 0.5 GB storage, compute scales to zero | First query after idle adds ~1 s. Text posts use very little space |

## 0. Put the code on GitHub (separate repo)

Render deploys from GitHub. Use a **new private repo containing only `inkwell/`**, not the whole
`Claude` folder, which holds unrelated projects.

```bash
cd inkwell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/inkwell.git
git push -u origin main
```

Check `git status` before pushing: `*.db` files and `node_modules/` should not be listed.

## 1. Database: Neon

1. Sign up at neon.tech (GitHub login works) and create a project named `inkwell`.
2. Open **Connect**. **Turn Connection pooling OFF** and copy the connection string
   (`postgresql://...`). The direct connection is the right one: migrations run on startup and
   use session-level locks, which pooled connections can break.

## The public site's Worker

`web/worker/index.js` is a small Cloudflare Worker deployed with the public site by the same
`wrangler deploy`. It adds each post's title, description and picture to the page so shared links
show a proper card, and it builds `/sitemap.xml` and `/rss.xml` from the API.

- It runs only for `/p/*`, `/sitemap.xml` and `/rss.xml` (`run_worker_first` in `web/wrangler.jsonc`).
  Every other request is a static file and does not count.
- Free plan: 100,000 Worker runs a day, never billed. Past that, those three kinds of address would
  fail until the next day (UTC); the rest of the site would keep working.
- If the API is asleep or down, a post page is served without its preview rather than failing.
- `API_BASE` in `web/wrangler.jsonc` must match `VITE_API_BASE` in `web/.env.production`.

**Turning on the link to your portfolio:** once `https://ahmadnadeem.dev` loads, set
`VITE_PORTFOLIO_URL=https://ahmadnadeem.dev` in `web/.env.production`, then rebuild and redeploy the
public site. That adds "About the author" to the header and footer and a contact line to the privacy page.

## 2. API: Render

1. Sign up at render.com with GitHub. **New + > Web Service**, pick the `inkwell` repo.
2. Settings:
   - **Name:** `inkwell-api` (Render may append a suffix, e.g. `inkwell-zpbc`; use whatever URL it shows you)
   - **Language:** Docker (it finds `Dockerfile` at the repo root)
   - **Instance Type:** **Free**
   - **Health Check Path** (under Advanced): `/health`
3. Environment variables:

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `Database__Provider` | `Postgres` |
   | `ConnectionStrings__Default` | the Neon string from step 1 |
   | `Jwt__Key` | a long random secret (generate below) |
   | `Cors__AllowedOrigins__0` | `https://inkwell.ahmadnadeem.dev` |

   ```bash
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
   ```

   Do **not** set `Seed__Enabled`. Seeding creates demo accounts with a published password, which
   must never exist on a public site.
4. **Create Web Service.** The first build takes several minutes. When the log shows
   `Now listening on`, open `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/health`. It should say `Healthy`.
   The database tables are created automatically on first start.

If Render gave the service a different URL (the name was taken), put that URL in
`web/.env.production` as `VITE_API_BASE`.

## 3. Frontend: Cloudflare

From the `inkwell` folder:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler deploy
```

`wrangler login` opens a browser so you can approve access to your Cloudflare account.
`wrangler deploy` uploads the build and, because `wrangler.jsonc` declares the custom domain, also
creates `inkwell.ahmadnadeem.dev` and its DNS record (your domain is already on that account).

## 4. Check it

Open https://inkwell.ahmadnadeem.dev (the first load may be slow while Render wakes up), register,
write a post, publish it, then open the post link in a private window.

## Updating later

- **API:** `git push`. Render rebuilds automatically.
- **Frontend:** `cd web && npm run build && npx wrangler deploy`.

## Good to know

- Rotating `Jwt__Key` signs everyone out.
- Keeping the API awake with a pinger would use roughly the whole 750-hour allowance, so it is
  better to accept the cold start.
- When you outgrow free tiers, the app needs no changes: only the Render plan and Neon plan move.

## Public sign-up is closed

The deployed site is read-only for visitors: no Sign in, Get started or "Start writing" prompts, no
clap or Save buttons, and no comment box. The API refuses sign-ups too (`403`), so hiding the buttons
is not the only protection. This is the default in Production (`Accounts:AllowPublicSignUp` is
`false` in `appsettings.Production.json`).

**To write or manage posts, sign in at `https://inkwell.ahmadnadeem.dev/login`.** The page still
exists but nothing links to it, so bookmark it. Sessions last 24 hours.

**To open sign-ups again**, set `Accounts__AllowPublicSignUp` to `true` in Render's environment
variables and let it redeploy. The prompts come back by themselves, because the web app asks the
API what the policy is. If the API cannot be reached the web app assumes "closed" and shows nothing.

## Security configuration

### One-time Cloudflare settings (dashboard, free)

1. **SSL/TLS > Edge Certificates > Always Use HTTPS: On.** Without it,
   `http://inkwell.ahmadnadeem.dev` answers in plain text instead of redirecting.
2. The site also sends an HSTS header, so browsers stick to HTTPS after the first visit.

### Optional: Turnstile bot check on sign-up (free)

Off until you configure it, and everything works without it.

1. Cloudflare dashboard > **Turnstile > Add widget**. Hostname: `inkwell.ahmadnadeem.dev`.
2. Put the **site key** in `web/.env.production` as `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, then rebuild and
   `npx.cmd wrangler deploy`.
3. Put the **secret key** in Render as `Turnstile__SecretKey`.

### How the protections work

| Control | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rate limits | API | Sign-in 10/min, sign-up 5/hour, search 30/min, other reads 300/min, writes 30/min, each per client |
| Real client address | API | Read from `CF-Connecting-IP` (set in `appsettings.Production.json`). Render sits behind Cloudflare, which always overwrites that header |
| Account lockout | API | 10 wrong passwords on one account in 15 minutes locks it for the rest of the window, whichever addresses the attempts came from |
| Password rules | API | 10+ characters, not a common password, not built from your name/handle/email, not in a known breach (checked via haveibeenpwned's k-anonymity API, so only 5 characters of a hash leave the server) |
| URL allow-list | API + web | Profile websites must be http(s); avatars and cover images must be https |
| Security headers | Cloudflare (`web/public/_headers`) and API middleware | CSP, nosniff, frame denial, HSTS, referrer policy |
| Session tokens | API | Valid for 24 hours (`Jwt__ExpiryMinutes` to change) |

### Verify the rate limiter after deploying

The limiter only works if the API can see each visitor's real address. Confirm it on the live
API (a clean run shows ten `400`s, then `429`s):

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 14); do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} " -X POST https://<your-service>.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"email\":\"user$i@example.com\",\"password\":\"x\"}"; done
```

If you never see a `429`, Render is not forwarding `CF-Connecting-IP`; the limiter then falls back to
the proxy's address. Account lockout still protects every account in that case.

### Known limits

- Session tokens live in the browser's local storage. Moving them to HttpOnly cookies needs the API
  on a same-site domain (for example `api.ahmadnadeem.dev`); on a separate `onrender.com` domain
  browsers block those cookies. The strict CSP and 24-hour expiry limit the exposure meanwhile.
- Tokens cannot be revoked before they expire.
- Sign-up does not verify email ownership; that needs an email provider.
- Registering reveals whether an email is already taken. The 5-per-hour sign-up limit makes
  harvesting slow; email verification is the real fix.
