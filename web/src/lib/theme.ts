 *                      of their own. It arrives from the API a moment after the page starts.
 *   the reader's look  two colours a reader picked for themselves with the palette button. It is
 *                      kept in this browser only and, while it exists, wins over the site's.
 *
 * Both are remembered in this browser and applied before anything is drawn, so a returning reader
 * never sees the page change colour, and a first-time reader sees the default until the API answers.
